Through this project, we sought to determine how race, gender, age, and a civilian\'s armed status affect their perceived threat level in fatal police shootings across the United States in recent years. Initially we hypothesized that male POC victims were seen as more threatening by police. After doing explanatory data analysis, logistical modeling, and hypothesis testing, we disproved our hypothesis for our specific dataset though we recognize the limitation of our data.
