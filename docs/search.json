Each observation provides information on geographical areas(country, state, county, and zip code) in the United States and their correlation with current and long-acting opioid rates and medicaid claims."

However, one per data set is required.)\nHow do opioid prescription rates differ by geography and time?\nHow are opioid prescription rates expected to change in the future based on geography?\nIs an individual’s medicaid plan predictive of their geography and opioid insurance claim?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nThis research topic will explore the correlation between geography, insurance plans, and the opioid epidemic. I would expect low-socioeconomic regions to be prone to high opioid prescriptions as the majority of opioid users are low income individuals. Also, I would expect the more generous insurance plans to have high variability with opioid prescribing rates as moral hazard contributes to accepting prescriptions.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.
