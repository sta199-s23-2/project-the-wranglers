I would expect low-socioeconomic regions to be prone to high opioid prescriptions as the majority of opioid users are low income individuals. Also, I would expect the more generous insurance plans to have high variability with opioid prescribing rates as moral hazard contributes to accepting prescriptions.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.

The study found that poorer areas, especially Western Appalachia, have significantly higher rates of opioid prescribing. Other factors that the study considered include the availability of physicians, the general strength of healthcare resources in the area, prescription monitoring laws, characteristics of the area’s populations, and other factors. The study found that the emergence of higher demand for treatment with opioids coupled with the exhaustion of medical resources along with the weak medical consensus on the appropriate use of opioids factor into the over-prescription crisis fueling the opioid epidemic.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nOur research question builds on the article cited by limiting the scope of patients to only Medicare beneficiaries. Because our data set only includes Medicare patients, our team can analyze how opioids are being prescribed to low-income and/or disabled individuals in the United States."

Data on these deadly encounters has been hard to come by, but five years later, newspapers, enterprising individuals and the federal government have launched ambitious data-collection projects to fill the gaps and improve transparency and accountability over how police officers exercise their right to use deadly force. Social scientists and public-health researchers have produced more than 50 publications to address pressing questions, such as whether the police are disproportionately quick to shoot black civilians and those from other minority groups. New databases show that police officers’ use of lethal force is much more common than previously thought, and varies significantly across the country.\nWe plan to track these differences which could help identify opportunities to reduce the number of shootings and deaths for both civilians and police officers."
